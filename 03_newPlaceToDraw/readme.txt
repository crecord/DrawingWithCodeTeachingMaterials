Hello Drawing with Code workshopper!

First of all here are the credits for this code: 
This code is a modification of a toxiclib example called terrainSteering.pde.
To get the full toxiclib library go here: 
http://toxiclibs.org/ 


The purpose of this code is to turn a black and white image (a drawing from a previous example) into a 3D terrain which you can steer over in a little car. 


Instructions:

1.) 
Install the "toxiclibs" libraries for processing! open up finder and go to documents/processing/libraries and place the two libraries (toxiclibs_p5 and toxiclibscore) in that folder. (you only need to do this once)

2.) 
If you want to use your own image and not the set example one, rename your black and white  image "facedoodle.jpg" and replace the image that is currently in the terrainSteering folder.

3.) 
Open the terrainSteering.pde in processing, press the play button to run the code. Use the  arrow keys to navigate the landscape.



P.S. If you have any trouble with this in future. You can email me at: recordcaroline@yahoo.com with questions.
