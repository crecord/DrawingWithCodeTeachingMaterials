Hello Drawing with Code workshopper!

First of all here are the credits for this code: 
Face OSC was written by Kyle McDonald and you can download and find more info here: 
https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/downloads
The examples are modifications of Dan Wilcox's example code: 
https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/FaceOSC-Templates


Instructions:

1.) 
double click on the file labelled "faceosc" 
if you see camera input you are doing great. 
If you don't see camera input check you are using the right version of faceosc for your  opperating system.(you can download the appropriate version here https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/downloads)
If that doesn't work edit the settings (see instructions at the bottom of this document) 

3.) 
Install "oscP5" library for processing! open up finder and go the documents/processing/libraries and place the osc folder inside. (you only need to do this once)

2.) 
open up one of the processing sketches and see if it compiles and reacts to your face. 



This code should work for the workshop, but if you try to use it elsewhere you may want to change around a few settings, here is how:
To edit the settings for FaceOSC, right click on the app and select "Show Package Contents". Inside the package, navigate to Contents/data/ and you'll find settings.xml.
